\details{
As part of the process in generating unique site codes, county and
site numbers are coerced to be strings to provide standard formatting.
As of the most recent package update, state codes are read in as strings
precluding the need to convert the file. However, in the future, the 
EPA may change the data format again, which may cause some errors in site
code formatting. 

The source of this data formatting is the inclustion of Canadian locations,
which have the state code "CC"
